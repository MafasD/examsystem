You will need  MongoDB for this
.env file should be changed to whatever database name you want to use for this app. (If the app won't work, you might need to create the database in mongoDB)
Since node_modules are not included, you will need to open exam_system folder in command prompt and run: npm install 
    This should install all necessary modules.
To run the app, open exam_system folder in command prompt and type: npm run start
    then go to this address on your browser: http://localhost:3000/
Login system is pretty simple, just register with whatever details, then login.
Currently, login system is only required for submitting exams.
The submit exam is really simple, it will just display the points you got on the exam, and then add the points to the database. 
    But in the database it will basically show total points of all exams submitted together, and currently there is no real way to see these points on the website, nor to reset them.
